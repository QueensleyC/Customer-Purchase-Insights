# Grocery Sales Analysis Project  

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of grocery sales data, exploring trends, patterns, and insights. The analysis was conducted using both R, with key findings presented through visually appealing plots and statistical summaries. The final outputs were compiled into a Quarto document and Jupyter Notebook for reproducibility and easy sharing.

## Project Objectives  

1. Analyze grocery sales data to uncover patterns and insights.  
2. Visualize trends over time, such as hourly, weekly, and product-specific sales.  
3. Highlight deviations from averages to identify anomalies or seasonal patterns.  
4. Determine top-performing and bottom-performing products by revenue.  
5. Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

## Tools and Technologies  

- **R**: Primary language for data manipulation and visualization.  
- **Quarto**: For creating a clean and interactive document to present the findings.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For exploration and analysis.  
- **ggplot2**: For creating professional and visually appealing plots in R.

## Key Features of the Analysis  

### 1. Hourly Sales Trends  
- **Objective**: Identify peak sales hours.  
- **Visualization**: A smooth line plot highlights sales variations across the day.  

### 2. Weekly Sales Trends  
- **Objective**: Observe weekly performance and deviations from the average.  
- **Visualization**: A bar chart shows weekly deviations, with bars extending upwards or downwards based on sales performance relative to the mean.  

### 3. Product-Specific Revenue  
- **Objective**: Identify top 10 and bottom 10 products by revenue.  
- **Visualization**: Clear bar charts with revenue values displayed above each bar.  

### 4. Product-Specific Trends Over Time (Milk Example)  
- **Objective**: Track sales for a specific product to identify seasonal or daily patterns.  
- **Visualization**: A line plot with smooth curves highlights daily sales fluctuations.  

### 5. Bottom Products Analysis  
- **Objective**: Investigate products contributing the least revenue.  
- **Visualization**: A bar chart showcasing the least-performing products by revenue.

## Future Work  

This analysis is not exhaustive. Some potential future directions include:   
1. Exploring seasonality trends using advanced time series models.  
2. Incorporating external factors like promotions or holidays for deeper insights.  
3. Using machine learning for predictive analytics, such as forecasting future sales or product demand.

## How to Run the Analysis  

### Using R  
1. Load the R script files in your IDE (e.g., RStudio).  
2. Install required libraries: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, etc.  
3. Run the scripts sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Results Presentation  

The final analysis is available in:  
1. **Quarto Document**: A polished report combining text, code, and visualizations.  
2. **Jupyter Notebook**: A step-by-step Python exploration.  

Both formats are self-contained.
